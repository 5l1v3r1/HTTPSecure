# HTTPSecure - Tool for Encrypting HTTP to HTTPS On Apache2 Servers

**Update:** Now Supporting SSL v3.0 TLS v1.3 Encryption!

Just a simple script I wrote to automate the use of HTTPS encryption for apache2 servers. It will produce a very secure 4096 bit key, SSL v3.0 signing, and TLS v1.3 connection encryption.

## Getting Started

To begin, run ``` sudo ./httpsercure.sh ``` and follow all instructions in the installer.

Once finished just type in ``` https://IP ``` and add an exception to access your site.

## Built With

* Ubuntu - Debian Linux OS
* Kali Linux - Pentesting OS developed by Offensive Security
* Apache2 - Easy-to-use package for hosting websites
* OpenSSL - Package for encrpyting communications over computer networks
* GitHub - This Website!
